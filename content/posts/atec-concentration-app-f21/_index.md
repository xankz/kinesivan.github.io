# Current Projects

**QuestRPG** is a VR single-player RPG developed solely by me in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for Oculus Quest headsets. This project was meant to explore and test what an RPG experience would be like in VR, for when I later plan on developing an open-world multiplayer version. Working in a [relatively-new open-source engine](https://godotengine.org/) proved to be difficult for this project, however, I gained a lot of experience working in 3D and VR along the way. The world and maps were created with the help of [Qodot](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/qodot-plugin), a Godot library for parsing Quake maps, and [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/), a free Quake-engine level editor.

**HVT5** is a voxel-based platformer also developed solo in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). The demo shown above is the product of my experimenting with a stylized modeling workflow ([Goxel](https://goxel.xyz/) for base geometry, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for clean-up and shading). Instead of using skeletons/rigging, the player animations were programmed to be dynamic (hands lag behind body, move up when jumping).

**UNAL** is a 2D pixel horror game prototype also developed solo in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Most of the development work went into the systems: movement and collisions, random and triggered events (e.g. lightning strike), interactions (going through door, talking to ghost) and dialogue.

**Moon.ORB** is a 2D pixel arcade game prototype also developed solo in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I mostly experimented with state machines in this prototype, both for the player/enemies and the game mode as a whole. Though not fully featured in the video, I also implemented a [roll-based loot table](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/loot-drop-best-practices) - a random set of rewards would be picked based on their weights and offered to the player after each round. (So far the only ones implemented were increased movement/mining speed).

I am interested in entering a games profession because I believe it is the perfect adapter for my skills. Growing up, I wasn’t very bright in the technical aspects of school - I remember getting in trouble for failing to write even a simple paragraph. The pursuit of knowledge never quite appealed to me, that is, until I used a computer for the first time. Playing computer games was my livelihood growing up, but I wasn’t just an avid gamer - for once, I was actually interested in the design and inner workings of games, and technology as a whole. I learned how to code at the early age of 9, writing simple scripts for the games I enjoyed playing, and later creating and publishing full-fledged modifications (mods) for others to enjoy. Programming became my most cultivated skill, but it didn’t stop there, for I obtained newfound interests for others like story-writing, art and modelling.

Everyone has an eye for something, just like artists have an eye for art and critics for movies. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I believe the long-term development of my skills and interests for game development as a whole have given me an eye for the true essence of games. I want to create worlds and experiences that others can willfully enjoy, while always striving to do better. Game development allows for creative expression and freedom, and I don’t think you can find that quality in most other jobs.

## Don’t Starve Game Analysis

Don’t Starve (and Don’t Starve Together, the multiplayer release) is an amazing survival game developed by Klei Entertainment back in 2013 that still holds up well today. While the stylized art and music choices give the game a great outlook, the well-crafted game mechanics and design also make it a joy-filled, hours-long experience for many players.

Each character is unique in their own abilities and weaknesses, and after starting your first game, you are helplessly thrown into the game world with little guidance of what to do next. Ease of access is a quality that greatly enhances the game in this regard - the controls are simple and the GUI is designed to give the player as much information as needed without risking confusion. With no straightforward goal (except the obvious, “don’t starve”), the player is left to explore the procedurally-generated game world at their leisure. Klei Entertainment’s design of the game logic in a way that keeps systems modularized, yet connected, allow for a wide range of possibilities and solutions to problems across the game. For example, the player’s first encounter with nighttime leads them to quickly realize the dangers it brings with it - the entire world becomes pitch black and without a light of some kind, they will die from the horrors of the night within seconds. The concept of “light” is well-defined within Don’t Starve: it allows the player to see, it keeps their character from going insane, and it can be created through a number of ways (such as crafting a simple torch, or setting a tree or bush aflame). To add to this point, another quality that Don’t Starve utilizes very well in its gameplay is the element of surprise. With each passing day in the game, the player inevitably learns more and more about what they can and can’t do, and most importantly what they need to survive. The procurement of wood is a prime example - tools and defenses at the beginning of the game require copious amounts of wood to make, which means depending on the player’s efficiency in resource-gathering, deforesting entire sections of land may be necessary. What the player may not realize during their first playthrough, however, is that Klei Entertainment already predicted this choice outcome and decided to implement a nasty Treeguard boss encounter to torment the player if they chop too much wood. It’s a simple design decision in and of itself, yet grants the game an ironic quality and leaves the player wondering what surprises will be waiting for them next.

Don’t Starve is a fun game to play in one’s spare time, even with friends if possible. The eye-catching graphics and music aren’t the only factors that give the game its quality, but the fundamental ease of access to its controls, a network of interconnected systems allowing for infinite choice, and lastly the occasional element of surprise to always keep the player on their toes.
